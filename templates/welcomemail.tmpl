Subject: Welcome to the cosmic.voyage!

Welcome ~newusername,

Your new account has been established. you can ssh into
cosmic.voyage with the ssh key you supplied on registration.

Your password is "newpassword". please change it when you log in
for the first time with 'passwd'. While we don't use passwords for
logins, they may be used on the system for authentication in the
future.

This tilde server is dedicated to a single activity, the
collaborative storytelling of the human stellar diaspora. We may
add other features over time that are designed to support the
story. For instance, we have an IRC daemon here that connects as
part of irc.tilde.chat. You can join and visit the #cosmic room to
discuss this server.

A note about folders and files:

The story content is available at /var/gopher. Within that
directory are all of the ships, outposts, settlements, and
communes of the diaspora scattered through time and space. These
entities are the basis for our stories. Rather than build your
content in a user folder, you can claim a ship or outpost and take
on its story.

To create a new ship you can run the 'ship' command like so:

$ ship "Super Awesome Ship Name"

Make sure your ship name is in quotes if it contains more than one
word, and please avoid using unicode characters in the ship names.
You can write unicode in your logs, but the scripts don't play nice
with the special characters as filenames. Once your ship is
active, you are the only one with access to its story.

To author a new message on the QEC, create a new text file in your
ship's directory (must end in .txt). Author your message in
whatever format fits your theme. Add as much character as you
like. When you're ready for the message to be posted to the relay,
run the 'log' command in the terminal. It will prompt you to send
any pending messages and what to title them. 'log' will add a link
to your message, but the message is still totally in your control.
If you need to change something later, just edit the file. There's
no need to run log again.

If you have any questions, send me a local mail or find me on irc.

Also, please consider joining the cosmic.voyage mailing list!

Thanks so much for joining. I can't wait to read your stories.
