Subject: System Upgrade

Hey ~USERNAME,

Yesterday I upgraded cosmic.voyage from Ubuntu 19.10 to 20.04. I ran
through all the stuff in our system menu and a few other odds and ends
and it appears that everything is working okay. If you encounter any
issues please let me know.

In other news the Tilde Net News system (run 'news') is now peering with
tilde.club, the first and largest tilde server. They seem pretty active,
so if you want to engage you can try that out. The news program under
the hood is called 'slrn' and you can read more on how to configure it
to your personal tastes here:

Our little community is up to 119 voyagers now. How exciting!

If you're still stuck at home and looking for a creative way to escape
the boredom, why not create a new ship or outpost and leave this Earth
far behind? See you out there.

Cheers,
tomasino
