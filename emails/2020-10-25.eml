Subject: NaNoWriMo

Hey ~USERNAME,

National Novel Writing Month (NaNoWriMo) begins in one week and to celebrate
I'm putting together 30 days of writing encouragement. I'll be sharing these on
tilde net news (use the "news" command and look in tilde.cosmic) as well as on
my gopher hole at gopher://gopher.black. I hope you'll check them out and find
some motivation within to help you tell some awesome stories.

While Cosmic Voyage may not be geared toward novel writing per se I'll be using
this season to put out as many new stories in the 'verse as I can. Will I write
50,000 words in November? Who knows? 

What about you? Do you have the story inside that's been dying to come out but
you haven't had the time? Maybe this month will be your opportunity to push it
along. Whether it's here on Cosmic or abroad I hope you find your voice.

Cheers,
tomasino
