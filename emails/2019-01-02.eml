Subject: Federating Email

Hi ~USERNAME,

Our lovely system is introducing some new federation features with
other pubnix servers. If you visit our IRC channel, you may have
already noted that it's on the tildeverse IRC server. This host
acts as one of the servers connecting into that same system.

We have two other basic federation systems being worked on:

1) Email - As of today, this server can send email to any of the
   following servers: 
   - *.circumlunar.space
   - grex.org
   - rawtext.club
   - sdf.org
   - tilde.team
   - tilde.town
   - yourtilde.com

   Any other outbound email is restricted. If you know of other
   pubnix's that should be added to the list, please send me
   a note and I'll add them. This goes toward the effort of
   keeping things story-focused, but playing nice with the
   pubnix-verse.

2) Finger - If you read gopher, solderpunk has written up an
   in-depth phlog post about his efforts to bring finger back to
   life in the pubnix space.

   gopher://zaibatsu.circumlunar.space/0/~solderpunk/phlog/were-bringin-finger-back.txt
   
   In short, you can finger users at cosmic.voyage and get some
   cool results back. Currently the system will share your .plan
   and .project files in your home directory if they exist (normal
   finger behavior) and also your ship roster. You can view the
   standard finger script on git here:

   https://tildegit.org/cosmic/cosmic/src/branch/master/efingerd/luser

   You can also:

   - finger latest@cosmic.voyage
   - finger uptime@cosmic.voyage
   - finger ping@cosmic.voyage
   - finger time@cosmic.voyage
   - finger fortune@cosmic.voyage

   Finally, solderpunk's "fellowsh" tool, built on top of finger,
   is available on the system. It's still in active development
   and I'll be pulling in updates as they're made.

Thanks to the advice of one of our writers, I've also created
a new 'menu' tool that offers an easy-to-use interface for many of
the common scripts on the server. It's also a great way to play
with and discover new things.

Finally, I want to tell you all you're super awesome. We broke 100
posts before the new year. If you finger uptime, you'll see that
we've been running for 42 days as of today. That's more than
2 logs per day! 

Keep up the amazing writing, everyone, and keep sharing the
system.

Bon voyage,
tomasino
