Subject: Anthology #1

Hi ~USERNAME,

One of our users, khuxkm, is putting together an anthology ebook
of our stories from 2018. He is inviting all authors who wrote
a story entry in 2018 to submit an introduction letter about
Cosmic Voyage or an introduction to their story. These will be
bundled into the ebook. If this works well, we'll likely generate
a new anthology each year.

If you'd like to participate, please go ahead and email
khuxkm@cosmic.voyage directly.

If you would like to discuss the anthology format or have
suggestions, you can email him or join us in the #cosmic IRC
channel on irc.tilde.chat. (run "chat" from cosmic command line)

Cheers, 
tomasino
