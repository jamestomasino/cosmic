    - 'rules' prints our very serious cosmic rules.
    - 'cosmic-ship "new ship name"' will make a new ship. You don't need
      help from tomasino anymore. Make ships on your own! If you screw up
      then tomasino can help you remove or rename them.
    - IRC bot's !roster command is getting some work done to remove the
      unicode characters and surround nicks in underscores.

    - 'log -n' helper to create new messages. See 'log -h'

    - 'roster' command alias for 'cosmic-roster', adds optional 'count'
      argument to see number of ships. Optional username arg to filter.
